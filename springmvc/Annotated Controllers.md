@ResponseBody

Writes directly to the response body versus view resolution and rendering with an HTML template.

@RequestMapping

It has various attributes to match by URL, HTTP method, request parameters, headers, and media types. You can use it at the class level to express *shared mappings* or at the method level to narrow down to a specific endpoint mapping.
